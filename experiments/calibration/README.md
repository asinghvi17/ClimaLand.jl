# ClimaLand calibration

This folder contains scripts to perform calibration on ClimaLand simulations, using [ClimaCalibrate.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCalibrate.jl).

Like other ClimaLand/experiments scripts, the Julia environment (Project.toml) is located in .buildkite

The structure of this folder currently mimics [ClimaAtmos.jl/calibration](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/tree/main/calibration).

## Documentation

To understand the dependencies of our calibration workflow, read the documentation of
[ClimaCalibrate.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCalibrate.jl) and [EnsembleKalmanProcesses].jl(https://github.com/CliMA/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl)
